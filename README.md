# Contract Signing Application

A simple Django-based web application for creating and signing contracts using the HelloSign API.

## Overview
This project allows users to create dynamic contract templates, send them for signing via the HelloSign API, and store signed contract details in a database. It provides a basic admin panel for managing contracts and supports testing with a local development environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Django**: Web framework for building the application.
- **HelloSign API**: For electronic signature requests and management.
- **VSCode**: Development environment with port forwarding for testing.
- **SQLite**: Default database (can be replaced with PostgreSQL for production).
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic templates for user interface.

Usage
Register/Login: Sign up or log in at /accounts/register/ or /accounts/login/.
Create a Contract: Go to /contracts/send_request/, fill out the form with your email, a recipient email, and contract text, then click "Send for Signing".
Sign the Contract: Follow the HelloSign link sent to your email to sign the contract.
View Success: After signing, youâ€™ll be redirected to /contracts/success/.
Manage Contracts: Access the admin panel at /admin/ with your superuser credentials to view and manage signed contracts.
Testing Notes
Email Matching: During testing, ensure the email of the registered account matches the recipient email in the contract form. This is a temporary limitation for local testing with HelloSign.
Local Environment: Use port forwarding (e.g., VSCode dev tunnels) to test with a public URL if needed. Update the REDIRECT_URL in .env and HelloSign dashboard accordingly.
Debug Mode: Keep DEBUG = True in settings.py for development to see detailed error messages.
